Files Included:
main.py
hashing.py
dict_actions.py
dictionary.txt
sample_input.txt
README.

**NOTE: dictionary.txt has been modified to not include trailing whitespaces After
the end of lines. The original dictionary.txt, however will also work.

Instructions:
An input file, sample_input.txt, is provided here for convenience. For other
input files, each password should be on a separate file, and the file should
be in the same directory as main.py. To start the program,
run the command:

python3 main.py

You will be prompted to enter the name of your input file. After input has been
processed, the results will be printed to the console as well as written to a
new file. A result of 'no' indicates that the input was not in the list of
passwords. A result of 'maybe' indicdates that the input may have been in the
list of bad passwords.
